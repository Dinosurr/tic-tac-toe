# tic-tac-toe
To run this you need to be able to use the module Numpy

When starting the program simply run main.py
stats will be saved to score.py, making changes to the file might break the program, please open with caution.

The program will let you chose to play with two players or against the computer


Program was written by me but inspired by https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/173753/object-oriented-tic-tac-toe-game
